                <h2>Is a martial arts prodigy, the self-proclaimed "Hero Hunter," and a major adversary of the Hero Association and Monster Association. He is a disciple of Bang and was once expelled from his dojo because he went on a rampage. Because of his fascination with monsters, he is commonly called the "Human Monster." Sitch of the Hero Association views him as a grave threat to the organization despite being only a human. After the Monster Association incident, Garou is currently being rehabilitated under Bang, who has retired from being a hero and intends for Garou to replace him.</h2>
